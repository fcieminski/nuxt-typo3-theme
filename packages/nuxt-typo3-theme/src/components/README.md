# Components

## UiComponents

Dumb components, not related with API content - just data consumers. 

## CeComponents

Content elements, related with API content. They may use UiComponents by providing API data.
CE are provided by API and generated by `CeRenderer` component which is responsible for iterating over whole colPos[x] array and matching specific `CeComponent` with types returned by API.

## CwComponents

Content wrappers, related with API content, but provided programmatically in the layouts.
